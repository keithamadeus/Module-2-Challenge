Started with To-do's to breakdown project into manageable segments:

  

```css

/* portfolio project images */

/* TODO: Add portfolio project images here*/

  

/* media queries */

  

/* TODO: add media query for a max-width of 980px */

  

/* TODO: add media query for a max-width of 768px */

```

  

Example of current state of CSS images along with content for accessibility.

  ```

/* portfolio project images */

  

/* TODO: Add portfolio project images here*/

#item1-img {

background-image:  url("../images/Horiseon_Social_Solution.gif"), linear-gradient(180deg, var(--secondary) 0%, var(--primary) 100%);
